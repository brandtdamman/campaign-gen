## About

### Origin

Throughout the period 2013-2015 (sigma one year), I wrote a series of applications:

- RPG Character
- Fantasy Map Generator
- Dungeon

While occasionally vague, the programs were the first large projects I developed in my early years of programming.  A compilation of these programs was developed as *Campaign Generator* (or *CampaignGen*).  This encompassed all three programs under a common application and color scheme.

### Revival

Fast forward to the time of writing (approx. seven years), I have decided to look back at the projects and observe how clunky and mismanaged they were.  *CampaignGen* as a whole is an excellent project and would be beneficial for many people; however, the state I left it in was not worth distributing publicly.

After almost eight years, I hereby introduce the repository where *CampaignGen* will be rewritten and be readily available for beginning and veteran RPG players alike.

### Current Progress

Progress related to the revival can be found in Projects and Wiki.  It is likely the revival timeframe will take a year to complete with other projects and academic work taking a higher precedent.  Information listed in subsequent sections may be inaccurate at times.  See Projects and Issues for possible circumstances.

## Purpose

As partially mentioned in the previous section, *CampaignGen* was designed to aid a beginning player/GM with the early creation of characters, maps, and/or dungeons.  This is successfully done via the multiple different sub-programs and usage of[OSRIC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OSRIC).  Other RPG handbooks may be used; however, OSRIC is licensed under Open Game License and more readily redistributable in *specific* fashions.  It is left to the user to create the necessary database files for other RPG games (Pathfinder, AD&D, etc.)

## Usage

*CampaignGen* is to be run on a Windows installation.  ~~Included in the repository is an InnoSetup script which can be compiled to produce the necessary SQLite database files and executables.~~
